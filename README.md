## 1. Introduction
The one-size-fits-all marketing approach is getting old. Customers are asking for more tailored products and services. The lead companies of tomorrow ought to understand their clients better. <br/><br/>
Identifying and organizing customer groups using specific variables and characteristics they have in common is commonly referred as **Customer Segmentation**. These variables could be personality traits, demographics, geography, or even their income. Segmentation provides in-depth consumer data that helps marketers tailor their products and services to customersâ€™ needs. This personalization gives companies a competitive advantage and a better chance at customer conversion and brand loyalty. <br/>
Demographic, Behavioral, and Geographical and 3 different types of customer segmentation. Today, we will be interested in the first one, and more specifically customers' ***gender***.

## 2. Folder content
In an effort to make this repository as easy to read as possible, I created 3 different ipynb files with a specific purpose each. <br/>
1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
    - Going through the data, taking notes, and visualizing patterns
2. Machine Learning models exploration
    - Testing different models, visualizing the output
3. Pipeline
    - Providing only the code relevant to the output

I suggest to read them in order.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This section is dedicated to EDA. We will explore the data, ask ourselves question, visualize features, and more. <br/>
Looking at the type of our 33 features, one can note the presence of 1 categorical variable (is_newsletter_subscriber), 3 float variables, and the rest as integers.
